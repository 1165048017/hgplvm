Two subjects from the [CMU Mocap data base](http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu) approach each other and 'high five'. The hierarchy models the subjects separately and jointly. It can be run with the command\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\n>> demHighFive1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nA visualisation of the result, including points that have been propagated through the hierarchy is given below.\r\n\r\n![](demHighFive_talk.png) \r\n\r\n*Joint visualisation of the two subjects that 'high five'. The points A, B, C, D, E, F, G and H have been propagated through the hierarchy and are shown on the right. Grey scale visualisations in the latent space have not been shown to keep the smaller plots clear.*\r\n\r\nA second example involves a subject modelled running and walking. In this case the separate limbs of the subject are split into a hierarchy as shown below.\r\n\r\n![](stickHierarchy.png) \r\n\r\n*Hierarchical decomposition of the skeleton. The limbs and abdomen are leaf nodes, behind which we build a hierarchical structure.*\r\n\r\nThis example can be reconstructed with\r\n\r\n```matlab\r\n>> demWalkRun1 \r\n```\r\n\r\nResults of applying the hierarchical structure to a combined data set of a run and a walk, using two root nodes, one for the run and one for the walk, are shown below.\r\n\r\n![](demWalkRun_portrait.png)\r\n\r\n*Visualisation of a walk and run jointly using hierarchical structures. Again several points have been propagated through the hierarchy.*\r\n\r\nPage updated on Wed Feb 14 08:50:14 2007\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-62968536-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
