Corrections made were primarily those given by Reviewer 2. Reviewer 2 specified several minor typos which have been rectified. The only other issue of note was the wider issue of the use of a MAP approximation. This has not been modified as it was apparent from the reviews that the risks had been made clear in the paper, and the only suggested improvement was to attempt other additional approximations. Such approximations are very involved in implementation and beyond the scope of the current paper (as the SPC appears to have implicitly acknowledged).
